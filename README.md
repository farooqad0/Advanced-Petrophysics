<li>The pairplot of logs of well are plotted through seaborn package:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/farooqad0/Advanced-Petrophysics/blob/main/Images/Pairplots.png" alt="Pairplot" /></p>
<p>It is helpful in detecting the patterns between each logs and identification of outliers in each log as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>The correlation matrix is visualized through seaborn package:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/farooqad0/Advanced-Petrophysics/blob/main/Images/Correlation_Matrix.png" alt="correlation_matrix" /></p>
<p>It provides the great insights regarding the weak and strong positive or negative correlation between each logs to indicate potential multicollinearity.</p>
<p>The several unsupervised machine learning algorithms are implemented on the desired logs to indicate the inliers and outliers in logs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Following unsupervised machine learning algorithms are implemented are as under:
<ul>
<li>Isolation Forest</li>
<li>Elliptic Envelope</li>
<li>Local Outlier Factor</li>
<li>One Class SVM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The report of quantity of inliers and outliers in each well logs are drawn through heatmap of seaborn package:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The curves of inliers vs outliers of each log are drawn in order to visualize the predictions of unsupervised machine learning algorithm:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The violin&nbsp;plots are plotted in order to check the distribution of the data of each curves, maximum amplitude of the violin plot shows greater density of data, the white dot inside each violin plot shows the median of the data.</li>
</ul>

<li>After, quality control of each well log through unsupervised machine learning algorithm, the pairplot of resultant predictions are drawn through seaborn package in order to visualize the patterns of each log.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The petrophysical conventional formulas are implemented to derive the petrophysical properties from the well logs and universal cut offs for reservoir facies are marked to derive facies from the petrophysical properties.
<ul>
<li>The Volume of Shale</li>
<li>Effective Porosity</li>
<li>Water Saturation</li>
<li>Reservoir Facies</li>
